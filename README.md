# OptimusSwitch
<i>It changes between wayland and xorg on GNOME when using optimus cards (only Ubuntu-based)</i> <br><br>
gpuswitch.sh -> It should be assigned to a shortcut on your GNOME (Settings->Devices->Keyboard)
<h3> The file gpuswitch.sh will call the file Optimus.sh at /home/$(logname)/Documents/workspace, so change it for your desired directory.</h3>
